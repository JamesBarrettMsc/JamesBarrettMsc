## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git & GitHub
- I would like to find or start a very small project I could  use as a sandbox of sorts.

### Disclaimer
My spelling is just awful and I tend to rely on speech-to-text software, So you will see lots of spelling & grammar mistakes throughout anything I have typed. 
(I do have dyslexia)
